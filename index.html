       Chess, a game that originated in India somewhere around <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess" target = "_blank" >1500 years ago</a>. It is a game that has gone through a lot of changes throughout the course of history,new rules were added as it travelled along the medieval silk routes but the esssence of the game remained the same 
       , you have a board with 64 squares and on which your objective is to put your opponents king in a situation such that it is being attacked by your piece(s) and it has no legal square to go to
       .
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <p class = "p3"> This seemingly simple game has been the source of fascination among  various societies and has led us to a point that playing chess and being good at it is seen as a sign of a genius ,which though is a tall claim but top grandmasters has shown us time and again that it is grounded in reality, like when they show us their insane memory retention abilities.<br>

        But every coin has a flip side. Historically,Chess was played as a passtime among the aristrocasy, a mindgame that even Napoleon Bonaparte played and even though chess was a very well known game, it had a reputation of a game for  the rich and the intellectually gifted<br>
        . And even though the former is no longer true, the latter has remained a constant for centuries when it comes to chess stereotypes. And hence chess participation has remained pretty low considering the fact that it is <a href = "https://ratings.fide.com/topfed.phtml">played by 184 countries</a>

      There is little doubt in the world wide belief that coronavirus is the worst challenge humanity has faced since the cuban missile crisis, taking the lives of over 813,000 people(as of 23rd August 2020), shattering our economies, forcing those priviliged enough into their homes and others on the mercy of the privileged and setting us decades back in innovation, among all this gloom, there is still a  very small silver lining for chess enthusiasts like me. <br>
      the much awaited chess boom is upon us and its has a rather unthinkable entity to thank, <em>the sars cov-2 virus</em>. With the pandemic raging through our communities resulted in people being lockdown in their homes. With no work and no outsie activity feasible people had to look for something produtive and time consuming to keep their sanity intact and many people found that in chess.
       But it wasn't so easy for chess to get into the limelight, it took the efforts of many people and coming to 2020 it was clear to many individuals that a chess revolution was on the horizons.

          To be able to trace back the second coming of chess to a single date or a single person is more of a tall order, throughout the recent years chess community was growing steadily as beginners were joining the community.But there was something that was hindering a large amount of people from taking interest in chess.
          <br>.
          
           Chess as a sport like cricket is played in different formats called <a href = "https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-types-of-chess-classical-rapid-blitz-and-others"> time controls</a>, the four major categories of chess being <strong>classical,rapid,blitz </strong> and <strong> bullet</strong>. World Championship matches till date are played in classical time format(120 minutes, with 60 minutes added after move 40, 15 minutes added after move 60, and 30 additional seconds per move starting from move 61) and it is not hard to imagine how big of a snoozefest it would be to  watch two players staring at a board for hours just thinking their moves.
           And it doesn't help that <a href = "https://www.chess.com/article/view/do-we-still-need-classical-chess">most of the classical matches are drawn in the end</a> and that GM level games were too complex for anyone lower than <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">chess masters to understand.</a>. Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it? Well in the internet age it was bound to change. With rapid(mainly 15+10) and blitz(3+2 and 5 min) time control gaining popularity<br>
            all that was needed was someone to explain the thought process of a super GM like Teimour Radjabov. And that void was filled by many <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chess&sp=EgIQAg%253D%253D">chess youtubers</a>.<br>
           Powered by very stong and open source chess engines like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)">stockfish</a> coupled by their own humanly insights made for a delightful watch for beginners and masters alike.
      </p>
      <p> But even with all this in place chess still needed a push to become mainstream and it got a very big one in the name of <strong>lockdown</strong></p>
      <h2>
          The Big Boom
      </h2>
      <p>
         2020. A new decade was upon us and for the chess community it was very important year as the biannual World Chess Championship was scheduled for this year. Chess lovers all over the globe were following closely on the developments of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_Tournament_2020">Candidates Tournament</a>, an 8 player double round robin tournament held in March, the winner
          of which would get to challenge Magnus Carlsen ,the 3 time World<br> Champion  in a 12 game Classical match . But with the coronavirus situation getting out of hand and no certain way out <a href = "https://www.espn.in/chess/story/_/id/28957051/fide-stops-candidates-tournament-yekaterinburg">FIDE had to stop the candidates tournament in the middle</a>. But what felt like a bane eventually turned out to be a boon for chess. The setback only helped a lot of people tuning into chess in large numbers. The cerebral nature of the game helped it to thrive in this pandemic with a lot of new chess channel coming up and a lot of established channels gaining a lot of subscribers 
          and followers.<br> And when every single sport has been affected horribly by this pandemic on the highest level its business as usual for chess, with the recently concluded <strong>Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour</strong> that saw the top players play rapid chess from the comfort of their homes.<br>
           It was a 4 event tournament followed by a 4 man finals that saw audience numbers never seen in chess before. At its peak viewership The Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour racked in a 100,000 thousand concurrent viewers on youtube and twitch combined.
